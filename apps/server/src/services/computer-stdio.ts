// Stdio connectors in their owner's computer (OPENBOT_STDIO_RUNNER=computer,
// the managed service's default). Each connector's server runs in the
// computer of the account that owns it, in the organization it belongs to:
// one computer per (organization, owner), its own container, firewall and
// egress rules, so no two accounts or organizations share a process or a
// filesystem. Starting the session starts the computer when it is off,
// through the same path a Bot's first computer tool takes (status events,
// audit); a restart after a crash never does, so a server whose computer was
// stopped stays down until it is next used. While the server is busy the
// computer counts as used, so the idle sweep does not stop it mid-call.
//
// When there is no computer, or it does not start, the session fails with a
// short message, which the manager stores as the connector's last error: it
// never falls back to running the server on this host.
