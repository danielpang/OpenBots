# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1
# The computer image: one sandbox per account with a browser, a filesystem and
# a terminal, driven by the control agent in apps/computer-agent (plan 9.1,
# 9.3). Build from the repository root:
#
#   docker build -f docker/computer.Dockerfile -t ghcr.io/openbot/computer .
#
# Every stage runs on the target platform, Node comes from the official image
# for that platform and Chromium from Playwright's per-arch download, so
# `docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64` works as is.
#
# The container expects the hardening of plan 9.5 from the provider: its own
# network, cap-drop ALL plus CHOWN, SETUID and SETGID, no-new-privileges,
# read-only root with volumes on /home/bot and /var/lib/openbot and a tmpfs
# on /tmp, and the agent token in /var/lib/openbot/token, never in the
# environment. It starts as root: the agent reads and deletes the token, lays
# out a private directory per screen, drops to the bot user, and starts every
# program through openbot-runas, so each screen runs as its own user (S-7,
# apps/computer-agent/src/privileges.ts).

# The full image carries python3, make and g++ for node-pty's native build.
