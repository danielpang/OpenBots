# Images and runtime architecture

OpenBots releases build **five custom Docker images**, but the Mac app does not run all five.
The Mac app's **This Mac** mode uses `server`, `computer` and `sandbox-firewall`, alongside
third-party dependencies. `relay` supports remote connectivity; `standalone` is an alternative
all-in-one deployment for hosting platforms.

An **image** is a packaged software environment. A **container** is a running instance of an
image. One image can serve several containers, so the image count is not the service count.

## The five images

Images are published under `ghcr.io/danielpang/openbots/<image>:<version>`; forks and development
builds can use another prefix.

| Image                  | What it is                                                                                    | Why it exists                                                                                                                                         | How it is used                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`server`**           | The OpenBots API, web UI, bot workers and scheduler.                                          | Coordinates chats, model calls, tools, routines, permissions and stored data.                                                                         | Runs in the local or remote Compose stack, connects to Postgres and Redis, and controls computers. The same image also runs the separate `docker-guard` service to validate Docker API requests.                             |
| **`computer`**         | A Linux workspace with a browser, filesystem, terminal and control agent.                     | Gives Bots somewhere to browse, execute commands and work with files without running those tasks directly on the Mac or inside the backend container. | The server creates computer containers on demand from this image. Home files persist in volumes separately from the image.                                                                                                   |
| **`sandbox-firewall`** | A small service that maintains Docker networking rules.                                       | Container separation alone does not prevent Bot commands from reaching sensitive services and networks.                                               | Runs alongside the Compose stack. Lets the server contact computer agents, while blocking computers from initiating connections to the server, other computers, the host, private/LAN networks and cloud metadata addresses. |
| **`relay`**            | An intermediary carrying encrypted connections between a paired phone and an OpenBots server. | Lets the phone reach a server behind a router or firewall without port forwarding or a public server address.                                         | Usually runs on shared infrastructure, not on the user's Mac. Also published for self-hosting. The server connects outbound; phone-to-server contents are end-to-end encrypted.                                              |
| **`standalone`**       | Server, Postgres, Redis and the computer agent/browser environment in one container.          | Supports hosting platforms that run one container but cannot run a Compose stack or create sibling computer containers.                               | An alternative to the Compose stack for personal hosting, including Fly Machines and Sprites. Persistent state lives under `/data`. It is not another component to add to the Mac stack.                                     |

## The Mac app's This Mac setup

The Mac app is an Electron shell around the web UI. Choosing **This Mac** starts a local Compose
stack through Docker Desktop or OrbStack. The server's HTTP port is bound to loopback so it is
not published to the LAN.

```text
Mac app (Electron UI)
        |
        v
OpenBots server -------- Postgres + Redis
        |
        +-- Docker API --> docker-guard --> socket proxy --> Docker daemon
        |                                                   |
        |                                         creates computers
        |                                                   |
        +-- control connection --------------------> computer agent
                                                     +-- browser
                                                     +-- terminal
                                                     +-- files

sandbox-firewall maintains the computers' network boundary.

Paired phone <--> shared relay <--> OpenBots server
             end-to-end encrypted tunnel
```

The computer containers are created at runtime, not declared as one fixed Compose service. They
join a sandbox network separate from Postgres and Redis. The server reaches their agents over an
authenticated control connection. Requests to create or manage containers pass through
`docker-guard`, which restricts them to the expected sandbox configuration; the server does not
get unrestricted access to the Docker socket.

`sandbox-firewall` applies rules in the **Linux Docker host's network namespace**, not the macOS
application firewall. It requires Docker-managed iptables; rootless Docker and Docker's nftables
firewall backend require equivalent rules applied separately. See the [stack networking and
hardening details](SELF_HOSTING.md#checking-the-container-hardening).

Postgres (`pgvector/pgvector`), Redis (`redis`) and the Docker socket proxy
(`tecnativa/docker-socket-proxy`) use third-party images. They are additional dependencies, not
part of the five images OpenBots builds. The `server` image is also reused by `docker-guard`, and
there can be multiple computer containers. **Five custom images does not mean five containers.**

### Where the relay runs

This Mac uses the shared OpenBots relay by default. The local server dials it outbound when a
phone is paired or a pairing is open. The phone connects to that relay to reach the server; the
relay cannot read the phone-to-server encrypted contents. It can see connection metadata such as
the server's host id, connection status and byte counts.

Users normally do **not** run the `relay` image locally. An operator can deploy it separately, or
self-host it with the Compose `relay` profile behind TLS. Push notifications also go through the
relay, but require the app's APNs key: a self-hosted relay without that key carries the tunnel,
not push notifications. See [phone connectivity](SELF_HOSTING.md#reaching-your-server-from-your-phone)
and the [relay README](../apps/relay/README.md).

The relay does not keep a sleeping Mac running. Bots and Routines pause while the Mac sleeps;
use an always-on remote deployment for work that must continue around the clock.

### Connecting to an existing server

Choosing an OpenBots account or an existing self-hosted server makes the Mac app a client of that
server. It does not start the local stack and does not need local Docker containers. The computers,
database and other services run wherever that server is hosted.

## Standalone: an alternative, not an extra service

The Compose stack separates the backend, database and Bot computers into different containers.
Standalone packages those processes into **one container**, using separate OS users and file
permissions rather than a separate computer-container network boundary.

| Concern              | Compose / This Mac                                                          | Standalone                                                                                                                   |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Backend and database | Separate from computer containers.                                          | Share one container with the computer environment.                                                                           |
| Bot commands         | Run in sandbox computer containers.                                         | Run as separate users beside the backend and database.                                                                       |
| Network isolation    | Sandbox firewall restricts access to the server, host and private networks. | Commands can reach the server's loopback port and the hosting machine's network. Server routes still require authentication. |
| Egress proxy         | Firewall can enforce configured proxy routing.                              | Proxy environment variables are advisory; programs can ignore them.                                                          |
| Persistent storage   | Separate database, file and computer-home volumes.                          | One `/data` volume; a Bot filling its home can also fill the database's disk.                                                |
| Best fit             | The normal Mac setup and deployments needing stronger isolation.            | Simple personal hosting on a platform that runs a single container.                                                          |

Standalone still protects server files and secrets with user separation, but it has a **weaker
network isolation boundary**. Cloud metadata access needs particular care: with `NET_ADMIN`, its
init process blocks the documented metadata addresses for Bot users; otherwise apply the
appropriate platform restrictions. Standalone is not equivalent to the sandboxed Compose stack.

See [deployment choices](../deploy/README.md), [standalone setup and settings](../docker/standalone/README.md)
and [security boundaries and known differences](SECURITY.md#14-standalone-image-and-a-self-hosted-relay).

## Why the release builds all five

The release workflow produces artifacts for several deployment modes, not just the Mac app:

- **Mac local runtime and Docker Compose:** `server`, `computer`, `sandbox-firewall`.
- **Shared relay operation and self-hosted relays:** `relay`.
- **All-in-one cloud or personal hosting:** `standalone`.

Publishing all five together gives these deployments images from the same release. The
[five-image release workflow](../.github/workflows/release-images.yml) builds and publishes them;
that does not mean each Mac needs to run them all. Published releases support Linux amd64 and
arm64, since the containers run in a Linux environment even when the app runs on macOS.

For local development, build only the three custom images needed by This Mac and use the
[instructions in the desktop README](../apps/desktop/README.md#testing-run-openbots-on-this-mac-against-images-built-from-source).
For Mac packaging and release operations, see [RELEASING.md](../apps/desktop/RELEASING.md).
