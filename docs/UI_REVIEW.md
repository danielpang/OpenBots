# UI removal pass (principle 10)

Part of the 1.0 gate ([TECHNICAL_PLAN.md](TECHNICAL_PLAN.md) 18.9). Every control in the web app is listed here with one question: **did this help someone delegate, or did it give them one more thing to manage?** Reviewed on 2026-10-24 against `apps/web/src` and the widget renderers in `packages/widgets/src/renderers`, and brought up to date on 2026-10-29 for the controls merged since: the setup wizard, the main Bot toggle, Thinking, usage, the sign-in request widget, the form and table widgets, attachments, Memory's Add, template visibility, users and invites, and the audit log.

**Verdicts:**

- **Keep**: it helps someone delegate, or a "Must" in [PRD.md](PRD.md) requires it.
- **Removed**: removed in this pass.
- **Filed**: it fails the bar, but the fix is bigger than a removal. Each one is listed under [Filed](#filed) with what to do.

The lens comes from the PRD principles. Runs, queues, models, sandboxes and MCP sessions stay beneath the interface (principle 2). Detail is tiered, and the activity log is the on-demand tier (principle 4). Coordination belongs to the Bots, not to dashboards (principle 8).

## Removed in this pass

| Control                                                                                       | Where                                                              | Why                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Enabled" checkbox in the Routine form                                                        | `apps/web/src/features/routines/routines-tab.tsx`                  | It duplicated the row's Pause/Resume and the `routine_run` widget's "Pause Routine". It was one more field on every edit. New Routines start enabled; pausing is one click on the row. |
| Model ID and token counts in the activity log footer                                          | `apps/web/src/features/transcript/activity-log.tsx`, `activity.ts` | Agent metadata, which is what Grok Bot removed. The footer keeps what reassures: the status when the run did not complete, the error, how long it took, and the cost estimate (L4).    |
| Raw built-in tool names (`web_search`, `http_request`, …) beside their labels in Bot Settings | `apps/web/src/features/tools/bot-tools.tsx`                        | The label already says it ("Web search"). The legend now reads "Hosts HTTP request may call".                                                                                          |

Also in this pass, a fix rather than a removal: the approval widget's stored state now keeps who decided and when (`apps/server/src/services/approvals.ts` `decision`, `services/runs.ts`). Before, a reload showed a request the run's cancellation had closed as "Denied by you", without a time.

## Every control

### App shell and sidebar

| Right-click menu: Pin/Unpin, Hide/Show, Duplicate, Save as template, Delete | Keep    | B1, B5, B6, B7. Duplicate and Delete are also in Bot Settings. The menu has no visible trigger, so Settings is the discoverable path and the menu is the fast one. |

| Provider keys: a key field per built-in provider (tested on save), Continue once one works | Keep    | L1: "the first-run wizard asks for at least one". Custom model providers wait for Settings, so the step stays one field per row. |
| First Bot: Name, Model, Create Bot                                                         | Keep    | D1, B2. The sandbox image pulls in the background with a status line, not a control.                                             |

| Preview toggle; Open full screen; Take control; Hand back | Keep    | K3. These are the three levels, and nothing more. Hand back also syncs the screen's cookies to every Bot's browser (K1), with nothing to press. A sign-in request's Take over opens this same view on the sign-in page (K8). |

### Webhooks (the inbox in Bot Settings, each Routine's endpoint with its Routine)

The people using these controls are writing a script or wiring a service. The HTTP details are their contract, so the raw headers, JSON, 202 and HMAC wording stay.
